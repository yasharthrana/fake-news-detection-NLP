# Fake News Detection using NLP

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to detect fake news based on textual data.

## Overview

Fake news detection is an important task in the age of information. The project analyzes a dataset of real and fake news articles and builds models to classify them.

**Main steps in this notebook:**
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer)
- Model building (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- Evaluation of model performance

## Dataset

The dataset contains labeled news articles classified as **real** or **fake**.
